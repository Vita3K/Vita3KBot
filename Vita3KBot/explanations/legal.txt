According to US law (the one Discord operates under), you own the game copy that you have purchased and are allowed to do with that copy as you please (such as back it up to your PC). 
Other copies are virtually identical, but they are owned by other people, therefore, you are not entitled to them. 
Emulators are legal under the pretext that you use legally dumped copies and homebrew on them. Read about Sony vs Bleem!, a case that set the precedent for emulation being legal. This video is also very informative: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj9Gk84jRiE
We do not support piracy, because doing so would give Sony legal ground to take us down. And yes, Sony is aware of Vita3K's existence.
